# Lecture 1

## How Did I Prepare Before Lecture?

What did I read?  What did I try?  How long did I spend?
What music was playing softly in the background (kidding, or not)?

## How Did I Contribute During Lecture?

Did I ask a question?  Did I answer a question?  Did I help another or
ask for help? Did I clean the whiteboard (no, seriously, Roberts got
in trouble for messy boards from 701 because he has a really bad memory)?

## What Was or Is The Most Confusing Thing?

Did I spend an embarassingly long time understanding a paragraph or
piece of code?  Did I figure it out or is it still the bane of my 
existence?  Did Roberts totally not explain something and I'm left here
alone with Google?
